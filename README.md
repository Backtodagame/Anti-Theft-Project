# Anti-Theft-Project
Hello Github Community!
This is my ARDUINO UNO project. I use RTC DS1307, LCD16x2 (I2C is not integrated with this LCD), sensor SIR 505, a buzzer and led. 
A LCD is used for show time 24/24 hour from that RTC.
When the time is between (0AM and 6 AM) that the time we are sleeping right ? 
The Anti Theft program is on, when there is a movement around SIR 505, the buzzer will loud and the light will also light 3 times. 
When no one arounds that sensor, nothing happens. 
Thank for your reading.
